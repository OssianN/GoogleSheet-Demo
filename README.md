# Google Sheet Api Demo

This repo uses Yarn as a package manager.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to show off a way to connect an online form to a Google Sheet. 

I've connected it to Contenful to create a "new event" and for each event a new Google Sheet is created.
When a user submits their information into the form on the site, the information will be passed on to the respective Sheet.

## Usecase

It can for example be used if you want to collect applications for a program or participant to events.
